    <p>These lemon poppy seed muffins sound delicious! I've always had a special place in my heart for anything citrus. I'll add my comments below once I've made it, as well as switch out the picture with one of my own.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="myUL">
        <li><span>2¼ cups all-purpose flour 313g</span></li>
        <li><span>2 teaspoons baking powder 8g</span></li>
        <li><span>¼ teaspoon baking soda 2g</span></li>
        <li><span>2 tablespoons poppy seeds 23g</span></li>
        <li><span>1 cup sugar 186g</span></li>
        <li><span>2 tablespoons lemon zest 6g</span></li>
        <li><span>1 cup whole milk greek yogurt 245g</span></li>
        <li><span>⅓ cup whole milk 78mL</span></li>
        <li><span>½ cup unsalted butter melted 113g</span></li>
        <li><span>2 large eggs 110g</span></li>
        <li><span>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 15mL</span></li>
        <li><span>1 teaspoon vanilla extract 5mL</span></li>
        <li><span>¼ teaspoon kosher salt 2g</span></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="myOL">
        <li><span>Preheat oven to 425F. Line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners.</span></li>
        <li><span>For muffins: In a large bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, and baking soda. Whisk in poppy seeds and salt.</li>
        <li><span> In another large bowl, combine sugar and lemon zest. Working with your hands, rub zest into sugar until fully combined. Add yogurt, milk, melted butter, eggs, lemon juice, and vanilla. Whisk until smooth. Pour into flour mixture and fold just until combined. (Batter will be thick.) Divide batter evenly among paper liners.</span></li>
        <li><span>Bake for 15 to 17 minutes or until tops are golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs. Let muffins cool in pan for 10 minutes. Remove and finish cooling on a wire rack.</span></li>
        <li><span>For glaze: In a small bowl, whisk together powdered sugar and lemon juice until smooth. Drizzle over cooled muffins.</span></li>
