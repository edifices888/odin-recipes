    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour (120g)</li>
        <li>⅓ cup natural unsweetened cocoa powder (33g)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoons of espresso powder</li>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter softened, (113g)</li>
        <li>½ cup light brown sugar (110g)</li>
        <li>⅓ cup granulated sugar (66g)</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips or dark chocolate chunks or chopped bars (180g)</li>    
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, sift together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat butter and sugars on medium speed until very light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add egg and vanilla and beat until well combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.</li>
        <li>With the mixer on low speed, gradually add the flour mixture, mixing just until combined. Stir in the chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Chill for 3 hours in fridge or 1 hour in freezer. Let thaw for 5-10 minutes. Otherwise dough will extremely sticky and cookies will spread.</li>
        <li>Scoop 1½ tablespoon-sized balls of dough on the cookie sheet, place about 2 inches apart.
        <li>Bake for 10 minutes or until cookie edges are firm and the center appears dry. Let cool on the sheets for 5 minutes. Transfer to wire racks to continue cooling. Store baked cookies in an airtight container for up to 5 days</li>
    </ol>
