    <h1>Samosa Recipe</h1>
    <p>This is the traditional samosa recipe that my sister created from home. It's "bare bones" currently, since we used youtube videos to teach us techniques.</p>
    <p>As time progresses in what I learn, I'll be sure to embed some of those youtube videos in this website. I'll also update this with more recipes. Anyways, it's perfect, since I needed a place to put our families recipes on. Thankfully this is part of the odin recipes project.</p>
