    <p>This is a traditional irish shepherd's pie recipe that my sister sent me. I still haven't had a chance to make this version yet. I'll update this page with any tips, tricks, or comments I've learned.</p>
    <p>I also used a picture from another site. Once I make it myself, I'll change out the picture.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 lb ground beef or 1 lb lamb</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely diced </li>
        <li>3 -4 large carrots, finely diced</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen peas and corn (optional)</li>
        <li>3 -4 sprigs fresh thyme, finely chopped </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 glass red wine</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce </li>
        <li>1 cup chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 large quantity mashed potatoes (I use two large russet potatoes)</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten </li>
        <li>grated parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat oven to 200C/400Â°F.</li>
        <li>Saute carrots in the olive oil until starting to get tender.</li>
        <li>Add in the onions and saute for a minute or two then add the meat.</li>
        <li>Season with black pepper and thyme.</li>
        <li>Cook until browned then drain fat.</li>
        <li>Add the butter and peas.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with flour and stir through.</li>
        <li>Add tomato paste, wine and Worcestershire sauce.</li>
        <li>Let this reduce slightly then add the chicken stock. Allow to reduce down until you have a thick meaty gravy. Season to your taste.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat. Grease an oven proof dish** (9x13 works for me, as does an oval baker) with butter and add the sauce.</li>
        <li>Spoon or pipe the mashed potatoes over top. Brush with egg and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese if using.</li>
        <li>Bake for about 20 minutes or until the potato is nice and browned on top.</li>
        <li>Serve as is or with some crusty bread to mop up that yummy sauce!</li>
    </ol>
